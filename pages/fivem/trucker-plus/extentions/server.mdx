# Extentions
Our script provides a way to extend the functionality of the script. This can be done by editing the `ext.lua` file in the `client` or `server` folder with the following code snippet:

## Cheat Prevention
This event will be triggered when the following checks failed:
- the money the player passed to the server is not the same as the money the server reads in the server-side instance of the config
- the player is not using a player owned truck and isn't near the depot location (where a mission is supposed to end)

```lua
AddEventHandler("Trusted:Trucker:Server:PlayerCheating", function(source)
    --- implement code here
end)
```

- source: `number` (the player's server id)

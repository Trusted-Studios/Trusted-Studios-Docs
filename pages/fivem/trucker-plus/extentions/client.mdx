# Extentions
Our script provides a way to extend the functionality of the script. This can be done by editing the `ext.lua` file in the `client` or `server` folder with the following code snippet:

## Truck Spawned
```lua
AddEventHandler('Trusted:Trucker:Client:TruckSpawned', function(entity, route)
    --- implement code here
end)
```

- entity: `number` (the entity of the truck)
- route: `string` (the route name)


## Goods Loaded
```lua
AddEventHandler('Trusted:Trucker:Client:GoodsLoaded', function(entity, route)
    --- implement code here
end)
```

- entity: `number` (the entity of the truck)
- route: `string` (the route name)

## Goods Unloaded
```lua
AddEventHandler('Trusted:Trucker:Client:GoodsUnloaded', function(entity, route)

end)
```

- entity: `number` (the entity of the truck)
- route: `string` (the route name)

## Truck Deleted
```lua
AddEventHandler('Trusted:Trucker:Client:TruckDeleted', function(entity, route)
    --- implement code here
end)
```

## Trailer Spawned
```lua
AddEventHandler('Trusted:Trucker:Client:TrailerSpawned', function(entity, route)
    --- implement code here
end)
```

## Trailer Deleted
```lua
AddEventHandler('Trusted:Trucker:Client:TrailerDeleted', function(entity, route)

# Extentions
Our script provides a way to extend the functionality of the script. This can be done by editing the `ext.lua` file in the `client` or `server` folder with the following code snippet:

## Notify
```lua
AddEventHandler("Trusted:Trucker:Client:Notify", function(message, type, duration)
    --- implement extention code
end)
```

- message: `string` (the message to display)
- type: `"error"|"warning"|"success"`
- duration: `number` (the duration of the notification)

```lua
AddEventHandler('Trusted:Trucker:Client:TruckSpawned', function(entity, route)
    --- implement code here
end)
```

- entity: `number` (the entity of the truck)

## Goods Loaded
```lua
AddEventHandler('Trusted:Trucker:Client:GoodsLoaded', function(entity, route)

- route: `string` (the route name)

## Goods Unloaded
```lua
AddEventHandler('Trusted:Trucker:Client:GoodsUnloaded', function(entity, route)

AddEventHandler('Trusted:Trucker:Client:TrailerSpawned', function(entity, route)
    --- implement code here
end)
```

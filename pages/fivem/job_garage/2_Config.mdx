# Configurations

The following config has been designed to provide highly flexible settings, allowing users to customize the script according to their specific needs. With its adjustable parameters, this script aims to cater to a wide range of requirements and ensure optimal adaptability.

## Framework

Defines the used Framework to allow the Script to be used on more servers. Frameworks which are supported by default are ESX Legacy, QBCore and Standalone. If you want to add your own Framework you can use bridge functions to do so. More information about the Bridge can be found [here](./Bridge/Functions).

<Tabs items={["ESX", "Standalone", "Other"]}>
    <Tab>
        ```lua copy
        Config.Framework = "ESX"
        ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab>
        ```lua copy
        Config.Framework = "Standalone"
        ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab>
        ```lua copy
        Config.Framework = "Other"
        ```
    </Tab>
</Tabs>

- frameworkName: `string`

<Callout type="warning">
    Please keep in mind that the script has only been tested with ESX Legacy. Thus the QBCore Version is only available at you own risk. If you want to make changes to the QBCore code you can do so in the Bridge section. More information about the Bridge can be found [here](./Bridge/Functions).
</Callout>

## Lock Distance

Defines the max distance within wich the player can lock or unlock a car.

```lua
Config.LockDistance = 3
```

## Default Lock Key 

This Script uses Keymappings to make sure that every player can individually dicide wich key they want to map to lock their cars. This config determines the default key, that can later be changed by the player.

```lua
Config.DefaultLockKey = "L"
```

## Garages

This is the main configuration as it defines new garages and their properties. We have implemented intelligent logic that seamlessly adapts to changes made to individual components during runtime, ensuring that the script remains functional even when certain components are modified or removed.

<Callout type='info'>
    Please note that not every component can be removed. Components that can be removed will be marked with a '?' symbol following their name (e.g., Blip?).

        Every Garage is identified by its key. The key represents the garage and contains all the options. 

        - Label: `string` 
        - Job?: `string` 
        - Coords: `vector3` or `vector4`
        - PedModel?: `string`
        - SpawnCoords?: `vector4`
        - Blip?: `table`
            - *Creates a blip on the map if added as an option.*
            - id: `number`
            - scale: `number`,
            - color: `number`

        *example:*
        ```lua copy
        Blip = {
            id = 1, 
            scale = 0.8, 
            colour = -1,
        },
        ```
        - Vehicles: `table`
            - *Contains a list of every vehicle in the garage.*
            <Callout type="warning">
                Every vehicle is represented via a key, value pair. This means that the vehicle spawn name is registered within it's key (e.g `['police']`) and all the options in the value wich are within a table.
            </Callout>
            - label: `string`

                    Every entry in the `defaultExtras` is registered as a key, value pair. This means that the extra you want to enable should have a key with a number (e.g. `[1]`) and the value `true`.

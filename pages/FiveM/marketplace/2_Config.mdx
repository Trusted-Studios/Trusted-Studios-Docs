# Config

The following options are provided to ensure the best individual experience.

## Framework

Determines the framework your server is using. If your server is running a framework that isn't supported by default please go to the [Bridge documentation](./3_Bridge) and follow the instructions on how to add a new framework.

```lua copy
Config.Framework = "ESX"
```

- Framework: `string`

## PriceChangeInterval

As the script simulates a price change (like prices changes in real life) you can set the random interval in wich prices will change. The numbers you set are minutes (1 = 1 min).
Every price change will be stored in a seperate file, wich is located at 'server/data/history.json'. This file is used by the script to display a graph wich visualize the price changes:

```lua copy
Config.PriceChangeInterval = {min = 1, max = 2}
```

- PriceChangeInterval: `table`
    - min: `number`
    - max: `number`

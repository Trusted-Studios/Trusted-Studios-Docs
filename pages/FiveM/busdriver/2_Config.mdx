# Configurations

During the creation of this script we've made sure that every important aspect is configurable to ensure that you can change the script to your needs.

## Framework
As the script is using a bridge to enable compatibility with every framework you need to make sure that your framework is name here.

```lua
Config.Framework = "ESX"
```

- Framework: `string`

## Duty Start
Define the location at wich a player can go on/off duty.

```lua copy
Config.DutyStart = {
    {coords = vec3(452.77, -621.58, 28.56), label = 'Bus Station Downtown LS'},
    {coords = vec3(1718.59, 4792.07, 41.98), label = 'Bus Station Blaine County'},
}
```

- DutyStart: `table`
    - coords: `vec3` (the position of the bus station)
    - label: `string` (the name of the bus station)

## Live Blip / Radar
Enable / disable the usage of a blip that acts as a live radar for players to see the location of a bus line. This blip isn't fully accurate and is only update every few seconds (or what you configured it to be).

```lua copy
Config.LiveBlip = true
```

- LiveBlip: `boolean`

## Live Blip / Radar Interval
Choose the interval for every update of the live radar. 

```lua copy
Config.LiveBlipInterval = 1e4 --> 10000
```

- LiveBlipInterval: `number`

## Need Job
Does the player need a job to be able to start bus lines.

```lua copy
Config.NeedJob = true
```

- NeedJob: `boolean`

## Start Location
Set the starting location of a bus line.

```lua copy
Config.Start = {
    ['X49'] = {coords = vec4(459.03, -633.20, 28.49, 220.00), bus_model = "bus", extra = 1, time = 7},
    ['071'] = {coords = vec4(1711.28, 4806.75, 41.81, 101.42), bus_model = "bus", extra = 1, time = 20},
}
```

- Start: `table`
    - Name of the bus line (Key): `table` 
        - coords: `vec4` (the location)
        - bus_model: `string` (the model of the bus used by the player)
        - extra: `number` (wich extra the bus should have **!! Currently not working !!**)
        - time: `number` (the amount of time in minutes to finish the line)

    *example:*
    ```lua copy
    ['X49'] = {coords = vec4(459.03, -633.20, 28.49, 220.00), bus_model = "bus", extra = 1, time = 7},
    ```

## Salary
Set the salary wich is binded to a bus line.

```lua copy
Config.Salary = {
    ["X49"] = 1200,
    ["071"] = 8000,
}
```

- Salary: `table`
    - Name of the bus line (Key): `number`

    <Callout type="warning">
        Please make sure that the key is matching the other keys! Otherwise the script will not bind the data!
    </Callout>

## Routes
Set the bus station of a bus line.

<Callout type="warning">
    The last stop is the end of the line. This means that if your last stop is in the middle of nowhere the player will be stuck there with no vehicle!
</Callout>

```lua copy
Config.Routes = {
    ["X49"] = {
        {bus_stop = "Strawberry Ave -> LSIA", coords = vec4(307.61, -766.03, 29.25, 162.15)},
        {bus_stop = "LSIA -> Downtown LS", coords = vec4(-1032.13, -2730.21, 20.12, 245.97)},
        {bus_stop = "Downtown LS", coords = vec4(457.85, -638.85, 28.50, 35.69)},
    },
    ["071"] = {
        {bus_stop = "Grapeseed Main Street -> Paleto Bay", coords = vec4(1829.96, 5066.94, 58.22, 305.90)},
        {bus_stop = "Paleto Bay -> Grapeseed", coords = vec4(-312.54, 6043.30, 32.23, 313.72)},
        {bus_stop = "Grapeseed", coords = vec4(1708.73, 4806.32, 42.64, 271.34)},
    },
}
```

- Routes: `table`
    - Name of the bus line (Key): `table`: 
        - bus_stop: `string` (name of the bus stop)
        - coords: `vec4` (location of the bus stop)
    
    *example:*
    ```lua copy
    ["071"] = {
        {bus_stop = "Strawberry Ave -> LSIA", coords = vec4(307.61, -766.03, 29.25, 162.15)},
    }
    ```

    <Callout type="warning">
        Please make sure that the key is matching the other keys! Otherwise the script will not bind the data!
    </Callout>

# FiveM Nitro/Nos Script 

The Nitro/Nos script enables the installation of external nitro bottles in vehicles. Activating the nitro with a designated button provides an immediate performance boost. A clear display indicates the available nitro level, allowing drivers to plan its usage effectively.

For safety, the script incorporates an intelligent security system. Nitro settings are saved using statebags, preventing any loss of nitro capacity during script restarts. This ensures a seamless experience for players, allowing them to pick up where they left off.
